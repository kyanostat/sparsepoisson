Minimax Predictive Density for Sparse COunt Data, K. Yano, R. Kaneko, and F. Komaki, (under review).
Abstract of the paper:

This paper discusses predictive densities under the Kullbackâ€“Leibler loss for high-dimensional Poisson sequence models under sparsity constraints. Sparsity in count data implies zero-inflation. We present a class of Bayes predictive densities that attain exact asymptotic minimaxity in sparse Poisson sequence models. We also show that our class with an estimator of unknown sparsity level plugged-in is adaptive in the exact minimax sense. For application, we extend our results to settings with quasi-sparsity and with missing-completely-at-random observations. The simulation studies as well as application to real data illustrate the efficiency of the proposed Bayes predictive densities.

Class PredDens_IM offers three methods:
* sample_gen returns sampling 
* log_likelihood returns predictive log likelihood
* CI returns coordinatewise coverage intervals 
* JointCI_count returns 1 if future observation is contained in the joint coverage set, 0 if not.
